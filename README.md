## Thesis results: clustering 

This repository has the source code for a cluster analysis that I performed on my [thesis data](https://github.com/jackvfb/identidrift).

**The notebook containing the analysis is published [_here_](https://jackvfb.github.io/thesis-clusters).**

### Contents

* ðŸ“ƒ`index.qmd`
  
   This is the notebook that I am sharing with my thesis committee to get their feedback on the suitability of the different clustering methods.
  
* ðŸ“ƒ `_quarto.yml`
  
   This tells quarto to render my notebook locally in the `docs/` directory, which I use when editing.
    
* ðŸ“ƒ `.gitignore`
  
   This tells git to ignore the local `docs` directory where I render my notebook. To actually publish the notebook I use `quarto publish gh-pages`
